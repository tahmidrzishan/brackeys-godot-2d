# Brackeys Godot 2D Tutorial

I followed the tutorial and made this game. Maybe this is the start of my gamedev journey.

## Why Godot

I chose Godot over Unreal and Unity for two things.
  1. It's FOSS
  2. My PC is a potato

## What did I change

  After following the whole tutorial as is, I did some customizations. First of all, I didn't add music. Because it's Haram. I added a scream sound effect for the death of the player. I programmed it to count as a win if the player collected 15 coins. I added the "Drive Forever" vocal version to celebrate the win. Also added some UI elements so that the player can start, restart, and quit the game whenever they wish.
